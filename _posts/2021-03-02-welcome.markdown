## Statement
Welcome, here is statement of this page.

The theme of this page is originally designed by Gabriel, named as _Nice Blog_. I forked from this theme and have added some interesting components to make it suitable be hanged on github. I agree with Gabriel that many blogs are over-designed, so the least requirement of my page is just seeming tidy. 

Again, my page is here <https://leo201313.github.io> and here <http://www.krad.top>. Hope you get you want.
